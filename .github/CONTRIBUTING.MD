## Contributing Localizations

Community submitted localizations are greatly appreciated, and allow FlagWar to be used by many others that may not
speak the language(s) used by the developers.

A few ground rules for translations:
- No machine-generated text translations. You cannot simply trust some files spat out by some bot running on Amazon,
  Google, or Microsoft servers to be accurate.
- Adhere to the [Java Locale][java-locales] language tag when naming your localization.
  That's `language_REGION(_VARIANT)`, generally. 
  If you are submitting a fake locale, such as upsidedown or piratespeak, use a common language and region, and set the
  fake locale as the variant. Ex: en_GB_PIRATE, en_US_INVERTED, es_MX_INVERTED.
- Make sure your language works - play test it. Building with Maven is super easy, and FlagWar will warn when the
  language cannot load, so there's no excuse. 
- All translation files need to be prefixed with `Translation_` and end with `.properties`. Without them, your locale
  will not load.

# Pull & Code Requirements

## Git Etiquette

1. Everything you do should (ideally) first be ticketed on the [issue tracker][issues] explaining the problem, or
   feature request.
    - Good reference specification for everyone. Others can review the issue and provide input.
    - Some features may be out of scope or issues closed for working as intended.
    
2. Do not work directly on the `main` branch, keep your changes separate from it.
    - Major features should have their own distinct branches, such as `feature/warflag_as_sheep`. When working against
      these branches, you should ensure that your PRs point to them, instead.
     
3. Utilize the commit messages to explain what you're doing. [Stop writing bad commit messages!][stop-soni]
   
   > ![Source: XKCD #1296](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_commit.png)  
   > ðŸ–¼ _[XKCD #1296, "Git Commit"][xkcd1296]_

4. Single-subject rule: Pull requests should be limited in scope to the related ticket(s).
    - See something else to tweak that is outside the PR's scope? Create a new branch and
      start the PR process for it separately. 
      
5. Don't PR incomplete work &mdash; if it doesn't compile, or isn't hooked up, keep it as a Draft PR until it is ready
   and has been tested.   

6. Test *everything* you have touched in at least a minimum playable environment on OpenJDK 11, with the API-targeted
   version of Paper.

## General Code Requirements

> â„¹ **Portability**  
> FlagWar makes use of `.gitattributes` and an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) files to help ensure consistent
> file portability among contributors. [Editors that support EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed)
> should automatically follow parts of this section. Some editors may require a
> [plugin](https://editorconfig.org/#download) to automate compliance.

> âš  **NOTICE**  
> _Maven will refuse to compile FlagWar if any files are out of the `.editorconfig` specifications. You can
> force compliance by running `mvn editorconfig:format` on a terminal, or through your IDE if it supports executing
> Maven plugins directly._

1. **Indentation: 4 Spaces**
    - No file should use tabs for indentation.
    - If your IDE is insane or doesn't respect the `.editorconfig`, please disable any automated source formatting in
      your IDE, or set it to use 4 spaces.
     
2. **Use Java Language Level 11**
    - Ensure your IDE is configured to use language level 11. If your IDE does not support setting the language level,
      ensure that you use a copy of OpenJDK 11 to avoid issues, or find a different IDE.
    
    - We target Java 11, because most hosts should support it by now - it will be required for servers running either
    Velocity and/or Paper going forward.
      
    - Servers not on Java 11 can use Towny 0.97.0.0, or earlier, to provide a deprecated copy of FlagWar.
    
3. **No Wildcard Imports**
    - Either directly import for each class (preferred),
      or specify the full path to a method (`io.townyadvanced.flagwar.FlagWar.someMethod()`) if there are fewer than two
      occurrences in a file (import still preferred).
      
    - If your IDE combines imports for you, disable the respective feature or bump its threshold up.
    
4. **Line Endings and New Lines**
    - Use Unix-style (LF) file line endings, and platform-neutral new lines in Java Strings (`%n` > `\n`)
        - Exception: Any Windows scripts (.bat, .cmd, .ps1) _should_ be CRLF formatted.
        - All modern editors support LF line endings on Windows, [including Notepad][notepad-lf]
          (Don't use notepad... ðŸ¤¦)
    - Use Platform-Neutral new-line characters when manipulating Strings.
        - `%n` is *always* a newline, regardless of the platform or JDK vendor, whereas `\n` is not guaranteed to be so.
    
5. **Use of Minecraft Server-specific Code**
    - Do not use NMS (`net.minecraft.server`) or server implementation-specific code.
    
- If you wish to incorporate Paper features, consider using PaperLib first. While we use Paper directly as the
      bukkit api provider, we would still like to keep Spigot compatibility if possible.
   
6. **Use of Reflection**
    - Reflection should be a _last resort_ reserved for special circumstances.
    - Reflection among our internal classes is **not acceptable**. This is of poor design, and should be refactored.
    
7. **Packet Handling**
    - The TownyAdvanced group is not interested in being held responsible for poor packet handling implementations. We 
      have chosen to leave these tasks up to the server implementation.
    - This also means no use of packet-manipulating libraries such as Netty and ProtocolLib.
     
8. **Deprecating Code** 
   When deprecating methods, the deprecated method should implement the replacement method to fallback gracefully. These
   methods should also be appropriately annotated in the Javadocs if public. If the code is being deprecated without a
   replacement, log why to the console.
   
   Don't forget to include the `since` and `forRemoval` fields in the `@Deprecated` annotation

   ```java
   /* Example */
   public class FlagWar {
        /**
         * Gets the FlagWar plugin instance.
         * @return the FlagWar instance.
         * @deprecated Use {@link io.github.townyadvanced.flagwar.FlagWar#getInstance()} instead.
         */
        @Deprecated(since="0.1.2", forRemoval = true)  // Use the next release tag, or put the date (MM/DD/YYYY format) 
        public static FlagWar getPlugin() {
            return getInstance();
        }
   }
   ```
   
9. **Code Wrapping** 
    - Checkstyle will complain if your code goes over 100 characters. Make it happy. (Run builds with `-P checkstyle` to
      validate.)
      
10. **Linting and Proactive Bug Smashing**
    - Plugins and tools like [CheckStyle][checkstyle], [SonarLint][sonarlint], and [SpotBugs][spotbugs] are highly
      beneficial, and can help you improve the readability of your code as well as detect bugs, code smells, and
      vulnerabilities.
      - We currently don't implement any CheckStyle style guidelines, but it is under consideration.
    - We may implement automation of these in the future, similarly to our implementation of automated EditorConfig
      verification.
      
11. **Comments**
    - Avoid using inappropriate Javadoc comments
        ```java
        /**
         * â›” Do not do this, unless you are writing Javadocs. Loose one of those leading asterisks.
         */
        ```
      
    - Avoid superfluous in-line comments. Let your code be self-documenting, if possible.
      
    - See a "walking" or otherwise inaccurate comment? Nuke it or modify it. A bad source of documentation hurts
      everyone.
      
    - Generally, avoid wrapping single-line comments as multi-line. Not a hard rule, but it distracts from the code.
      
12. **Refactoring**
    - Do not be afraid of refactoring code. Ownership of clean code is responsibility of everyone, not a single dev.
        - That being said, try not to commit something completely unmaintainable. Be kind, rewind.
      
    - If you have trouble reading a method, others likely have the same issue. Extract methods as required to improve
      high level readability, and keep your own methods as small as you can.
      
    - Scout's rule: Always leave the repository cleaner than you found it.

## Dependency Inclusion

For the sanity of the rest of us, please adhere to the following guidelines when attempting to
include a dependency or 3rd-party library.

1. Libraries need to be approved by the current maintainer before being merged.
   If you are adding a dependency, make your case for it in your PR, or in a separate ticket.

2. Prevent ClassNotFound errors - Do not reference a plugin in a loaded class, unless it is enabled.

3. No "Black Box" or Obfuscated dependencies.
   - All dependencies should have their source open and auditable.

4. Libraries and code snippets need to be of a compatible license with ours.
   - Do not violate either project's license in implementing your changes.
   - 3rd Party code without a license will be denied outright under the understanding that the original author is
     reserving all rights. Please ask them to offer an open source software license, and to grant license to any patents
     as required.

5. Any additional libraries or files under copyright of someone else need to be added to the
   `NOTICE` file. Please list the author, the copyright, the license, and path to the file(s) if it
   is not imported through maven.
   
6. Only use official maven repositories, or use JitPack. Don't use Kevin's Sonatype repository just because he already 
   has everything. We don't want builds to break due to using community mirrors. Also, try to stick to HTTPS.
